### Algorithm used - DBSCAN
DBSCAN - Density Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise \
Clusters are dense regions in the data space, separated by regions of the lower density of points. The DBSCAN algorithm is based on this intuitive notion of “clusters” and “noise”. The key idea is that for each point of a cluster, the neighborhood of a given radius has to contain at least a minimum number of points.
