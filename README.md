## Mobile Price Prediction</br>
    In this project, I have predicted the price of Mobile phones with input parameters as multiple features.
**Algorithm Used**</br>
    A **Support Vector Machine** (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.
